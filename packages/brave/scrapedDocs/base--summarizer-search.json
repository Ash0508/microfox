The following sections describe how to curate requests including parameters and headers to Brave Summarizer Search API and get a response back.\n\nAccess to summarizer is available through the Pro AI plan.\n\nEndpoints\n\nBrave Summarizer Search API exposes multiple endpoints for specific types of data for a given query. The endpoints that can be used to get a summarized response to a query are given below.\n\n\nhttps://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search\nhttps://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/summarizer/search\nhttps://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/summarizer/summary\nhttps://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/summarizer/summary_streaming\nhttps://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/summarizer/title\nhttps://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/summarizer/enrichments\nhttps://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/summarizer/followups\nhttps://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/summarizer/entity_info\n\nExample\n\nAn initial request has to be made to the Web Search API endpoint with a given query. An example CURL request is given below.\n\n\n\ncurl -s --compressed \"https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=what+is+the+second+highest+mountain&summary=1\" \\\n  -H \"Accept: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Accept-Encoding: gzip\" \\\n  -H \"X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>\"\n\n\nThe response specification for the Web Search API request above can be seen in the (WebSearchApiResponse) model.\n\nIf the query is eligible for a summary or an answer, as in this case, a summarizer key is provided in the response.\n\nThe key is equal to summarizer key (key) as part of the (Summarizer) response model. An example is below:\n\n{\n  \"summarizer\": {\n    \"type\": \"summarizer\",\n    \"key\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"what is the second highest mountain\\\", \\\"country\\\": \\\"us\\\", \\\"language\\\": \\\"en\\\", \\\"safesearch\\\": \\\"moderate\\\", \\\"results_hash\\\": \\\"a51e129180225a2f4fe1a00984bcbf58f0ae0625c97723aae43c2c6e3440715b}\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe key should be treated as a string and passed as is. The format can change in the future.\n\nThe key can be used to poll the summarizer endpoint for the summarized content. Requests to summarizer are not counted towards your plan and only the initial request to web search endpoint is billed based on the selected plan. An example request is below:\n\n\n\ncurl -s --compressed \"https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/summarizer/search?key=%7B%22query%22%3A%22what%20is%20the%20second%20highest%20mountain%22%2C%22country%22%3A%22us%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22en%22%2C%22safesearch%22%3A%22moderate%22%2C%22results_hash%22%3A%22a51e129180225a2f4fe1a00984bcbf58f0ae0625c97723aae43c2c6e3440715b%22%7D&entity_info=1\" \\\n  -H \"accept: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Accept-Encoding: gzip\" \\\n  -H \"x-subscription-token: <YOUR_API_KEY>\"\n\n\nThe summarizer results are cached for a limited time, after which the flow has to be started again to get summarized content.\n\nThe response specification for Summarizer Search API can be seen in the SummarizerSearchApiResponse model.\n\nNext Steps\n\nTo learn what parameters are available and what responses can be expected while querying Brave Search, please review the following pages:\n\nQuery Parameters\nRequest Headers\nResponse Headers\nResponse Objects\nExamples",
