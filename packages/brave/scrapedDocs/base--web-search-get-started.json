The following sections describe how to curate requests, including parameters and headers, to Brave Web Search API and get a JSON response back.\n\nTo try the API on a Free plan, you’ll still need to subscribe — you simply won’t be charged. Once subscribed, you can get an API key in the API Keys section.\n\nEndpoints\n\nBrave Search API exposes multiple endpoints for specific types of data, based on the level of your subscription. If you don’t see the endpoint you’re interested in, you may need to change your subscription.\n\nhttps://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search\n\nExample\n\nA request has to be made to the web search endpoint. An example CURL request is given below.\n\n\n\ncurl -s --compressed \"https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=brave+search\" \\\n  -H \"Accept: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Accept-Encoding: gzip\" \\\n  -H \"X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>\"\n\n\nThe response specification for Web Search API can be seen in the WebSearchApiResponse model.\n\nNext Steps\n\nTo learn what parameters are available and what responses can be expected while querying Brave Web Search API, please review the following pages:\n\nQuery Parameters\nRequest Headers\nResponse Headers\nResponse Objects\nBrave Local Search API\nIntroduction\n\nBrave Local Search API provides enrichments for location search results.\n\nAccess to Local API is available through the Pro plans.\n\nEndpoints\n\nBrave Local Search API is currently available at the following endpoints and exposes an API to get extra information about a location, including pictures and related web results.\n\nhttps://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/local/pois\n\n\nThe endpoint supports batching and retrieval of extra information of up to 20 locations with a single request.\n\nThe local API also includes an endpoint to get an AI generated description for a location.\n\nhttps://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/local/descriptions\n\nExample\n\nAn initial request has to be made to web search endpoint with a given query. An example CURL request is given below.\n\n\n\ncurl -s --compressed \"https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=greek+restaurants+in+san+francisco\" \\\n  -H \"Accept: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Accept-Encoding: gzip\" \\\n  -H \"X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>\"\n\n\nIf the query returns a list of locations, as in this case, each location result has an id field, which is a temporary ID that can be used to retrieve extra information about the location. An example from the locations result is given below.\n\n{\n  \"locations\": {\n    \"results\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"1520066f3f39496780c5931d9f7b26a6\",\n        \"title\": \"Pangea Banquet Mediterranean Food\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"d00b153c719a427ea515f9eacf4853a2\",\n        \"title\": \"Park Mediterranean Grill\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"4b943b378725432aa29f019def0f0154\",\n        \"title\": \"The Halal Mediterranean Co.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe id value can be used to further fetch extra information about the location.
