Some are required, but most are optional.\n\nPARAMETER\tREQUIRED\tTYPE\tDEFAULT\tDESCRIPTION\nq\ttrue\tstring\t\t\n\nThe user’s search query term. Query can not be empty. Maximum of 400 characters and 50 words in the query.\n\n\ncountry\tfalse\tstring\tUS\t\n\nThe search query country, where the results come from.\n\nThe country string is limited to 2 character country codes of supported countries. For a list of supported values, see Country Codes.\n\n\nsearch_lang\tfalse\tstring\ten\t\n\nThe search language preference.\n\nThe 2 or more character language code for which the search results are provided. For a list of possible values, see Language Codes.\n\n\nui_lang\tfalse\tstring\ten-US\t\n\nUser interface language preferred in response.\n\nUsually of the format ‘<language_code>-<country_code>’. For more, see RFC 9110. For a list of supported values, see UI Language Codes.\n\n\ncount\tfalse\tnumber\t20\t\n\nThe number of search results returned in response.\n\nThe maximum is 20. The actual number delivered may be less than requested. Combine this parameter with offset to paginate search results.\n\n\noffset\tfalse\tnumber\t0\t\n\nThe zero based offset that indicates number of search results per page (count) to skip before returning the result. The maximum is 9. The actual number delivered may be less than requested based on the query.\n\nIn order to paginate results use this parameter together with count. For example, if your user interface displays 20 search results per page, set count to 20 and offset to 0 to show the first page of results. To get subsequent pages, increment offset by 1 (e.g. 0, 1, 2). The results may overlap across multiple pages.\n\n\nsafesearch\tfalse\tstring\tmoderate\t\n\nFilters search results for adult content.\n\nThe following values are supported:\n\noff: No filtering is done.\n\nmoderate: Filters explicit content, like images and videos, but allows adult domains in the search results.\n\nstrict: Drops all adult content from search results.\n\n\nfreshness\tfalse\tstring\t\t\n\nFilters search results by when they were discovered.\n\nThe following values are supported: - pd: Discovered within the last 24 hours. - pw: Discovered within the last 7 Days. - pm: Discovered within the last 31 Days. - py: Discovered within the last 365 Days… - YYYY-MM-DDtoYYYY-MM-DD: timeframe is also supported by specifying the date range e.g. 2022-04-01to2022-07-30.\n\n\ntext_decorations\tfalse\tbool\t1\t\n\nWhether display strings (e.g. result snippets) should include decoration markers (e.g. highlighting characters).\n\n\nspellcheck\tfalse\tbool\t1\t\n\nWhether to spellcheck provided query. If the spellchecker is enabled, the modified query is always used for search. The modified query can be found in altered key from the query response model.\n\n\nresult_filter\tfalse\tstring\t\t\n\nA comma delimited string of result types to include in the search response.\n\nNot specifying this parameter will return back all result types in search response where data is available and a plan with the corresponding option is subscribed. The response always includes query and type to identify any query modifications and response type respectively.\n\nAvailable result filter values are: - discussions - faq - infobox - news - query - summarizer - videos - web - locations\n\nExample result filter param result_filter=discussions, videos returns only discussions, and videos responses. Another example where only location results are required, set the result_filter param to result_filter=locations.\n\n\ngoggles_id\tfalse\tstring\t\t\n\nGoggles act as a custom re-ranking on top of Brave’s search index. For more details, refer to the Goggles repository. This parameter is deprecated. Please use the goggles parameter.\n\n\ngoggles\tfalse\tlist[string]\t\t\n\nGoggles act as a custom re-ranking on top of Brave’s search index. The parameter supports both a url where the Goggle is hosted or the definition of the goggle. For more details, refer to the Goggles repository. The parameter can be repeated to query with multiple goggles.\n\n\nunits\tfalse\tstring\t\t\n\nThe measurement units. If not provided, units are derived from search country.\n\nPossible values are: - metric: The standardized measurement system - imperial: The British Imperial system of units.\n\n\nextra_snippets\tfalse\tbool\t\t\n\nA snippet is an excerpt from a page you get as a result of the query, and extra_snippets allow you to get up to 5 additional, alternative excerpts.\n\nOnly available under Free AI, Base AI, Pro AI, Base Data, Pro Data and Custom plans.\n\n\nsummary\tfalse\tbool\t\t\n\nThis parameter enables summary key generation in web search results. This is required for summarizer to be enabled.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also optimise your search query by using search operators.\n\n# Local Search API\n\nThis table lists the query parameters supported by the Local Search API. Some are required, but most are optional.\n\nPARAMETER\tREQUIRED\tTYPE\tDEFAULT\tDESCRIPTION\nids\ttrue\tlist[string]\t\t\n\nUnique identifier for the location. Ids can not be empty.
