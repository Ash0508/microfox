For example, you cannot create a group that contains 100 videos and 100 playlists.\n\nAn Analytics group can only contain resources that you have uploaded or claimed or that are linked to a channel that you administer. As a result, channel owners can create groups of videos and playlists. Content owners can create groups of videos, playlists, channels, or assets.\n\nMethods\n\nThe API supports the following methods for groups resources:\n\nlist\nReturns a list of groups that match the API request parameters. For example, you can retrieve all groups that the authenticated user owns, or you can retrieve one or more groups by their unique IDs. Try it now.\ninsert\nCreates a YouTube Analytics group.
