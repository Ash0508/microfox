This effectively means that the report is filtered to only include data if the country_code dimension's value is US.

The id for the current version of this report is content_owner_ad_rates_a1.\n\ncontent_owner_ad_rates_a1\nStatus: current\n\nThe id for this version of this report is content_owner_ad_rates_a1. The ID of the previous version of this report, which is now fully deprecated, was content_owner_ad_performance_a1.\n\nThe only difference from the previous version is that this version updates report name to use the word rates instead of the word performance. As a result, the report itself has the same version number (a1) as the previous version, but the report ID is different.\n\nContents\nDimensions:\ndate, channel_id, video_id, claimed_status, uploader_type, country_code, ad_type\nMetrics:\nestimated_youtube_ad_revenue, ad_impressions, estimated_cpm\nEstimated revenue reports\n\nEstimated revenue reports provide the total estimated revenue for videos from Google-sold advertising sources and from non-advertising sources.

It also contains some ad performance metrics. Note that the channel_id dimension identifies the channel that uploaded the video_id for which metrics are being provided. The id for the current version of this report is content_owner_asset_estimated_revenue_a1.\n\ncontent_owner_asset_estimated_revenue_a1\nStatus: current\n\nThe id for this version of this report is content_owner_asset_estimated_revenue_a1.

As a result, the report itself has the same version number (a1) as the previous version, but the report ID is different.\nContents\nDimensions:\ndate, channel_id, video_id, asset_id, claimed_status, uploader_type, country_code\nMetrics:\nestimated_partner_revenue, estimated_partner_ad_revenue, estimated_partner_ad_auction_revenue, estimated_partner_ad_reserved_revenue, estimated_partner_red_revenue, estimated_partner_transaction_revenue\nAsset reports\n\nAsset reports provide user activity metrics related to videos that are linked to a content owners' assets. A video is included in a content owner's report if the content owner has claimed that video as a match of one of the content owner's assets. The video could have been uploaded by the content owner or by another YouTube user.\n\nIn asset reports, the channel_id dimension identifies the channel that uploaded the video_id for which metrics are being provided.\n\nNote: User activity metrics in asset reports might be incorrect for the day that a video was claimed. The discrepancy arises from the fact that the metrics in the report reflect all user activity for that day rather than just activity that occurred after the claim was made.\n\nFor example, on a particular day, suppose a video is viewed 10 times, then it is claimed, and then it is viewed another 10 times. The asset report for that day will state that the video was viewed 20 times, even though only 10 of those views occurred after the claim took place. Metrics on all successive days should accurately reflect user activity related to the claimed video.\nUser activity\n\nThis report provides statistics related to users' actions on videos linked to a content owner's assets.
