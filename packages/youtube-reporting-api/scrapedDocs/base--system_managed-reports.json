YouTube automatically generates these reports for any content owners that have access to the corresponding reports in Reports menu.

All of the system-managed reports that are currently available are monthly reports.\n\nSome reports are customized to include relevant fields for different content types. For example, the Aggregate ad revenue per asset report contains an episode_title field for TV content and an album field for music labels.
