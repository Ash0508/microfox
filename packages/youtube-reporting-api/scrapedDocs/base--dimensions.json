This API retrieves bulk reports that contain YouTube Analytics data for a channel or content owner.\n\nDimensions are common criteria that are used to aggregate data, such as the date on which user activity occurred or the country where users were located.\n\nEach bulk report supports a predefined list of dimensions, and, in any report, each row of data has a unique combination of dimension values. As such, each row's combination of dimension values functions as the primary key for that row. You neither need to specify nor have the option of specifying which dimensions are included in the report.\n\nCore dimensions\n\nWhile the YouTube Reporting API is subject to the Deprecation Policy defined in the Terms of Service, non-core dimensions (and non-core metrics) are not subject to the policy. In the definitions on this page, any dimension that is a core dimension is explicitly identified as such.\n\nThe following list identifies the API's core dimensions. All of them are also core dimensions in the YouTube Analytics API.\n\nage_group\nchannel_id\ncountry_code\ndate\ngender\nsharing_service\nuploader_type\nvideo_id\n\nFor more information, see the list of the YouTube APIs subject to the Deprecation Policy.\n\nDimensions\n\nThe following sections define the dimensions that are used in the YouTube Reporting API's bulk reports. Unless otherwise noted, these dimensions are used in both channel and content owner reports.\n\nResources\n\nThese dimensions correspond to resources that channels and content owners manage on YouTube:\n\nvideo_id\nplaylist_id\nchannel_id\nasset_id\nvideo_id (core dimension)\nThe ID of a YouTube video. In the YouTube Data API, this is the value of a video resource's id property. This is a core dimension and is subject to the Deprecation Policy.\nplaylist_id\nThe ID of a YouTube playlist. In the YouTube Data API, this is the value of a playlist resource's id property.\nchannel_id (core dimension)\nThe ID for a YouTube channel. In the YouTube Data API, this is the value of a channel resource's id property. This is a core dimension and is subject to the Deprecation Policy.\nasset_id (only used in content owner reports)\nThe ID of an asset managed in YouTube's Content ID system. An asset is the representation of your intellectual property in that system. On the YouTube website, you can locate asset IDs in YouTube Content Manager. You can also retrieve them using the YouTube Content ID API.\nGeographic areas\n\nThese dimensions identify a geographic region associated with user activity, ad performance, or estimated revenue metrics.\n\ncountry_code (core dimension)\nThe country associated with the metrics in the report row. The dimension value is a two-letter ISO-3166-1 country code, such as US, CN (China), or FR (France). The country code ZZ is used to report metrics for which YouTube could not identify the associated country. This is a core dimension and is subject to the Deprecation Policy.\nprovince_code\nThe U.S. state or territory associated with the metrics in the report row. The dimension value is an ISO 3166-2 code that identifies a U.S. state or the District of Columbia, such as US-MI (Michigan) or US-TX (Texas). The province code US-ZZ is used to report metrics for which YouTube could not identify the associated U.S. state.\n\nNote: This dimension does not support ISO 3166-2 values that identify U.S. outlying areas since those territories also have their own ISO 3166-1 country codes. It also does not support subdivisions of countries other than the United States.\n\nTime periods\ndate (core dimension)\nThis dimension identifies the date associated with the metrics in each report row. In bulk reports, the date refers to the period beginning at 12:00AM Pacific time and ending at 11:59PM Pacific time on the specified day, month, and year. Depending on the time of year, Pacific time is either UTC-7 or UTC-8.\n\nNote that while dates typically represent a 24-hour period, dates when clocks are adjusted forward for Daylight Savings Time represent a 23-hour period, and dates when clocks are adjusted backward represent a 25-hour period. This is a core dimension and is subject to the Deprecation Policy.\nPlayback locations\n\nThese dimensions provide insight about the page or application where user activity occurred.\n\nplayback_location_type\nThis dimension identifies the type of page or application where user activity occurred. The following table lists dimension values:\n\nValues\n0\nThe data pertains to activity that occurred on the video's YouTube watch page or in an official YouTube application, such as the YouTube Android app.\n1\nThe data pertains to activity that occurred on another website or application where the video was embedded using an <iframe> or <object> embed.\n2\nThe data pertains to activity that occurred on a YouTube channel page.\n5\nThe data pertains to metrics that cannot be classified into one of the other listed location types.\n7\nThe data pertains to views that took place on the YouTube home page or home screen, in the user's subscription feed, or in another YouTube browsing feature.\n8\nThe data pertains to views that took place directly on the YouTube search results page.\n10\nThe data pertains to views that took place on the YouTube Shorts feed.\nplayback_location_detail\nThis dimension specifies the URL or application where the playback occurred. This dimension is only supported for views that occurred in embedded players, which means that the dimension value is only populated in rows where the dimension's value is 1. In other rows, this dimension's value is empty.\nPlayback details\nlive_or_on_demand\nThis dimension indicates whether the user activity metrics in the data row are associated with views of a live broadcast. Data for this dimension is available for dates beginning April 1, 2014.\n\nThe following table lists dimension values:\n\nValues\nlive\nThe row's data describes user activity that occurred during a live broadcast.\nonDemand\nThe row's data describes user activity that did not occur during a live broadcast.\nsubscribed_status\nThis dimension indicates whether the user activity metrics in the data row are associated with viewers who were subscribed to the video's or playlist's channel. Possible values are subscribed and unsubscribed.\n\nNote that the dimension value is accurate as of the time that the user activity occurs. For example, suppose a user has not subscribed to a channel and watches one of that channel's videos, then subscribes to the channel and watches another video, all on the same day. The channel's report indicates that one view has a subscribed_status value of subscribed, and one view has a subscribed_status value of unsubscribed.\nTraffic sources\ntraffic_source_type\nThis dimension identifies the referrer type associated with the user activity metrics. The referrer type describes the manner in which users reached the video or channel associated with the row of data in the report.
