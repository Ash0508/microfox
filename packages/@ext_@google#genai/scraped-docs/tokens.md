Long words are broken up into several tokens. The set of all tokens used by the model is called the vocabulary, and the process of splitting text into tokens is called tokenization.\n\nFor Gemini models, a token is equivalent to about 4 characters. 100 tokens is equal to about 60-80 English words.\n\nWhen billing is enabled, the cost of a call to the Gemini API is determined in part by the number of input and output tokens, so knowing how to count tokens can be helpful.\n\nSend feedback\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
