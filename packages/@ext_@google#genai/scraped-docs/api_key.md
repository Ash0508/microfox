You can create a key with a few clicks in Google AI Studio.\n\nGet a Gemini API key in Google AI Studio\n\nSet up your API key\n\nFor initial testing, you can hard code an API key, but this should only be temporary since it is not secure. The rest of this section goes through how to set up your API key locally as an environment variable with different operating systems.\n\nLinux/macOS - Bash\nmacOS - Zsh\nWindows\n\nBash is a common Linux and macOS terminal configuration. You can check if you have a configuration file for it by running the following command:\n\n~/.bashrc\n\nIf the response is \"No such file or directory\", you will need to create this file and open it by running the following commands, or use zsh:\n\ntouch ~/.bashrc\nopen ~/.bashrc\n\nNext, you need to set your API key by adding the following export command:\n\nexport GEMINI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>\n\nAfter saving the file, apply the changes by running:\n\nsource ~/.bashrc\nSend your first Gemini API request\n\nYou can use a curl command to verify your setup:\n\ncurl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=${GEMINI_API_KEY}\" \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -X POST \\\n  -d '{\n    \"contents\": [\n      {\n        \"parts\": [\n          {\n            \"text\": \"Write a story about a magic backpack.\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }'\nKeep your API key secure\n\nIt's important to keep your Gemini API key secure. Here are a few things to keep in mind when using your Gemini API key:\n\nThe Google AI Gemini API uses API keys for authorization. If others get access to your Gemini API key, they can make calls using your project's quota, which could result in lost quota or additional charges for billed projects, in addition to accessing tuned models and files.\n\nAdding API key restrictions can help limit the surface area usable through each API key.\n\nYou're responsible for keeping your Gemini API key secure.\n\nDo NOT check Gemini API keys into source control.\nClient-side applications (Android, Swift, web, and Dart/Flutter) risk exposing API keys. We don't recommend using the Google AI client SDKs in production apps to call the Google AI Gemini API directly from your mobile and web apps.\n\nFor some general best practices, you can also review this support article.\n\nSend feedback\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
