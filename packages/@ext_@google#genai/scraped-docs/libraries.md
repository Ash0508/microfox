If you're new to the Gemini API, get started with the API quickstart.\n\nImportant note about our new libraries\n\nWe've recently launched a new set of libraries that provide a more consistent and streamlined experience for accessing Google's generative AI models across different Google services.\n\nKey Library Updates\n\nLanguage\tOld library\tNew library (Recommended)\nPython\tgoogle-generativeai\tgoogle-genai\nJavaScript\nand TypeScript\t@google/generative-ai\t@google/genai\nCurrently in Preview\nGo\tgoogle.golang.org/generative-ai\tgoogle.golang.org/genai\n\nWe strongly encourage all users of the previous libraries to migrate to the new libraries. Despite the JavaScript/TypeScript library being in Preview, we still recommend that you start migrating, as long as you are comfortable with the caveats listed in the JavaScript/TypeScript section.\n\nPython\n\nYou can install our Python library by running:\n\npip install google-genai\n\nJavaScript and TypeScript\n\nYou can install our JavaScript and TypeScript library by running:\n\nnpm install @google/genai\n\n\nThe new JavaScript/TypeScript library is currently in preview, which means it may not be feature complete and that we may need to introduce breaking changes.\n\nHowever, we highly recommend you start using the new SDK over the previous, deprecated version, as long as you are comfortable with these caveats. We are actively working towards a GA (General Availability) release for this library.\n\nAPI keys in client-side applications\n\nWARNING: No matter which library you're using, it is unsafe to insert your API key into client- side JavaScript or TypeScript code. Use server-side deployments for accessing Gemini API in production.\n\nGo\n\nYou can install our Go library by running:\n\ngo get google.golang.org/genai\n\nPrevious libraries and SDKs\n\nThe following is a set of our previous SDK's which are no longer being actively developed, you can switch to the updated Google Gen AI SDK by using our migration guide:\n\nPrevious Python library\nPrevious Node.js library\nPrevious Go library\nPrevious Dart and Flutter library\nPrevious Swift library\nPrevious Android library\nSend feedback\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
