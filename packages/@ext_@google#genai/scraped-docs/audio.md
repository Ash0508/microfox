Always use the Files API when the total request size (including the files, text prompt, system instructions, etc.) is larger than 20Â MB.\n\nThe following code uploads an audio file and then uses the file in a call to generateContent.\n\nPython\nJavaScript\nGo\nREST\nfrom google import genai\n\nclient = genai.Client(api_key=\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\n\nmyfile = client.files.upload(file=\"path/to/sample.mp3\")\n\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n    model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\", contents=[\"Describe this audio clip\", myfile]\n)\n\nprint(response.text)\n\n\nTo learn more about working with media files, see Files API.\n\nPass audio data inline\n\nInstead of uploading an audio file, you can pass inline audio data in the request to generateContent:\n\nPython\nJavaScript\nGo\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nwith open('path/to/small-sample.mp3', 'rb') as f:\n    audio_bytes = f.read()\n\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n  model='gemini-2.0-flash',\n  contents=[\n    'Describe this audio clip',\n    types.Part.from_bytes(\n      data=audio_bytes,\n      mime_type='audio/mp3',\n    )\n  ]\n)\n\nprint(response.text)\n\n\nA few things to keep in mind about inline audio data:\n\nThe maximum request size is 20 MB, which includes text prompts, system instructions, and files provided inline. If your file's size will make the total request size exceed 20 MB, then use the Files API to upload an audio file for use in the request.\nIf you're using an audio sample multiple times, it's more efficient to upload an audio file.\nGet a transcript\n\nTo get a transcript of audio data, just ask for it in the prompt:\n\nPython\nJavaScript\nGo\nmyfile = client.files.upload(file='path/to/sample.mp3')\nprompt = 'Generate a transcript of the speech.'\n\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n  model='gemini-2.0-flash',\n  contents=[prompt, myfile]\n)\n\nprint(response.text)\n\nRefer to timestamps\n\nYou can refer to specific sections of an audio file using timestamps of the form MM:SS. For example, the following prompt requests a transcript that\n\nStarts at 2 minutes 30 seconds from the beginning of the file.\n\nEnds at 3 minutes 29 seconds from the beginning of the file.\n\nPython\nJavaScript\nGo\n# Create a prompt containing timestamps.\nprompt = \"Provide a transcript of the speech from 02:30 to 03:29.\"\n\nCount tokens\n\nCall the countTokens method to get a count of the number of tokens in an audio file. For example:\n\nPython\nJavaScript\nGo\nresponse = client.models.count_tokens(\n  model='gemini-2.0-flash',\n  contents=[myfile]\n)\n\nprint(response)\n\nSupported audio formats\n\nGemini supports the following audio format MIME types:\n\nWAV - audio/wav\nMP3 - audio/mp3\nAIFF - audio/aiff\nAAC - audio/aac\nOGG Vorbis - audio/ogg\nFLAC - audio/flac\nTechnical details about audio\nGemini represents each second of audio as 32 tokens; for example, one minute of audio is represented as 1,920 tokens.\nGemini can only infer responses to English-language speech.\nGemini can \"understand\" non-speech components, such as birdsong or sirens.\nThe maximum supported length of audio data in a single prompt is 9.5 hours. Gemini doesn't limit the number of audio files in a single prompt; however, the total combined length of all audio files in a single prompt can't exceed 9.5 hours.\nGemini downsamples audio files to a 16 Kbps data resolution.\nIf the audio source contains multiple channels, Gemini combines those channels into a single channel.\nWhat's next\n\nThis guide shows how to generate text in response to audio data. To learn more, see the following resources:\n\nFile prompting strategies: The Gemini API supports prompting with text, image, audio, and video data, also known as multimodal prompting.\nSystem instructions: System instructions let you steer the behavior of the model based on your specific needs and use cases.\nSafety guidance: Sometimes generative AI models produce unexpected outputs, such as outputs that are inaccurate, biased, or offensive. Post-processing and human evaluation are essential to limit the risk of harm from such outputs.\nSend feedback\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
