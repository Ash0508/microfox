Gemini models process PDFs with native vision, and are therefore able to understand both text and image contents inside documents. With native PDF vision support, Gemini models are able to:\n\nAnalyze diagrams, charts, and tables inside documents\nExtract information into structured output formats\nAnswer questions about visual and text contents in documents\nSummarize documents\nTranscribe document content (e.g. to HTML) preserving layouts and formatting, for use in downstream applications\n\nThis tutorial demonstrates some possible ways to use the Gemini API to process PDF documents.\n\nWhat's next\n\nTo learn more, see the following resources:\n\nFile prompting strategies: The Gemini API supports prompting with text, image, audio, and video data, also known as multimodal prompting.\nSystem instructions: System instructions let you steer the behavior of the model based on your specific needs and use cases.\nSend feedback\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
