No functions were provided in the given text. The text describes various Gemini models, their capabilities, and versioning.  Therefore, I cannot generate function documentation.  Instead, I will provide a structured summary of the Gemini models described in the text.

## Gemini Models Overview

This document provides an overview of the various Gemini models available through the Gemini API.  Gemini models are categorized by generation, variation, and version (stable, preview, or experimental).

### Model Variants

| Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 04-17 (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`) | Audio, images, videos, and text | Text | Adaptive thinking, cost efficiency |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (`gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`) | Audio, images, videos, and text | Text | Enhanced thinking and reasoning, multimodal understanding, advanced coding, and more |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash (`gemini-2.0-flash`) | Audio, images, videos, and text | Text | Next-generation features, speed |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview Image Generation (`gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation`) | Audio, images, videos, and text | Text, images | Conversational image generation and editing |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite (`gemini-2.0-flash-lite`) | Audio, images, videos, and text | Text | Cost efficiency and low latency |
| Gemini 1.5 Flash (`gemini-1.5-flash`) | Audio, images, videos, and text | Text | Fast and versatile performance across a diverse variety of tasks |
| Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B (`gemini-1.5-flash-8b`) | Audio, images, videos, and text | Text | High volume and lower intelligence tasks |
| Gemini 1.5 Pro (`gemini-1.5-pro`) | Audio, images, videos, and text | Text | Complex reasoning tasks requiring more intelligence |
| Gemini Embedding (`gemini-embedding-exp`) | Text | Text embeddings | Measuring the relatedness of text strings |
| Imagen 3 (`imagen-3.0-generate-002`) | Text | Images | Advanced image generation |
| Veo 2 (`veo-2.0-generate-001`) | Text, images | Video | High-quality video generation |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash Live (`gemini-2.0-flash-live-001`) | Audio, video, and text | Text, audio | Low-latency bidirectional voice and video interactions |


### Model Versioning

* **Latest Stable:** `<model>-<generation>-<variation>` (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash`)
* **Stable:** `<model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>` (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash-001`)
* **Preview:** `<model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>` (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`)
* **Experimental:** `<model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>` (e.g., `gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05`)

### Experimental Models

Experimental models are released for early access and feedback. They are not recommended for production and may have stricter rate limits.  They can be replaced without notice.

### Previous Experimental Models

The document lists replaced experimental models and their replacements.  This information is crucial for maintaining compatibility if using older experimental model versions.

### Supported Languages

A list of supported languages is provided, ranging from Arabic (`ar`) to Vietnamese (`vi`).

### Tokens

One token is approximately equivalent to 4 characters for Gemini models, and 100 tokens are roughly 60-80 English words.


This structured summary provides a clear overview of the Gemini models and their characteristics.  For specific usage instructions and API details, consult the official Gemini API documentation.
